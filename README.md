# S_python_software_example
This is a basic example of an external software pluggable to the Cytomine platform.

This python script is used as an example into our documentation on [how to integrate an external software into Cytomine](https://doc.cytomine.org/Add-an-external-software-to-Cytomine)

It contains the descriptor, the Dockerfile and the script itself.
